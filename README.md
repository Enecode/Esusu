<h1>Setup Instructions for all the APIs</h1>
This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and use the APIs endpoints 

- http://localhost:9000/user/
- http://localhost:8000/group/
- http://localhost:8000/member/
- http://localhost:8000/collection/
- http://localhost:8000/collectTable/
- http://localhost:8000/contribution/
- http://localhost:8000/groupadmin/
- http://localhost:8000/savings/ 

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
- Python and the requests library.
- Access to the endpoint URLs above.
- API credentials, which can be obtained from the API administrator.
<h2>Endpoint URL</h2>
The endpoint URLs above represents a resource of resources related to all the APIs. You can use these endpoints to 
perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on `user`, `group`, `member`, `collection`, `collectTable`, `contribution`, `groupadmin`, `savings`data.

<h2>API Authentication</h2>
The API uses Basic Authentication, which requires a username and password. You will need to include your API credentials in the Authorization header of each API request.

<h2>API Requests</h2>
The API uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on the `user`, `group`, `member`, `collection`, `collectTable`, `contribution`, `groupadmin`, `savings`, data.

- To retrieve a list of all `user`, `group`, `member`, `collection`, `collectTable`, `contribution`, `groupadmin`, `savings` , you can make a GET request to the endpoint URLs.
- To create a new `user`, `group`, `member`, `collection`, `collectTable`, `contribution`, `groupadmin`, `savings` , you can make a POST request to the endpoint URLs with the data in the request body.
- To update an existing `user`, `group`, `member`, `collection`, `collectTable`, `contribution`, `groupadmin`, `savings` , you can make a PUT request to the endpoint URLs with the updated data in the request body.
- To delete a `user`, `group`, `member`, `collection`, `collectTable`, `contribution`, `groupadmin`, `savings` , you can make a DELETE request to the endpoint URLs with the each endpoints ID in the request body.

<h2>API Responses</h2>
The API returns a JSON response for each API request. The response includes a status code, such as 200 (OK) or 404 (Not Found), and a JSON payload with the response data.
In case of a successful API request, the response will include the all the endpoints data. In case of an error, the response will include an error message.

<h2>Error Handling</h2>
You should check the status code of the APIs response to determine if the APIs request was successful or not. In case of an error, you can refer to the APIs documentation for a list of common error codes and messages, and how to handle each error.

<h2>Testing</h2>
You can use the requests library to test the APIs. You can start by making a simple GET request to retrieve a list of all endpoints, and verify that the API returns a 200 (OK) response with the API data. You can then test the other API operations (POST, PUT, DELETE) to ensure that you are able to perform all CRUD operations on the endpoints data.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
These are the basic steps for setting up and using the API endpoints for `user`, `group`, `member`, `collection`, `collectTable`, `contribution`, `groupadmin`, `savings`.
